# About
SkolTech course

This course provides an overview of modern blockchain technology and its' practical applications (Cryptocurrency, Certification, Anchoring. Industrial examples.) We will make a short introduction into basic cryptography and distributed database systems and show how these tools are used in blockchain. The covered topics are the following: 

-) Introduction to cryptography, type of ciphers. Public key cryptosystems

-) Hash functions.Digital signatures and certificates. Public key infrastructure

-) Secret sharing and esoteric protocols

-) Introduction to database systems. Distributed database systems

-) Proof of smth concept

-) Bitcoin, ethereum and smart contracts

-) Types of consensus, laws about blockchain

# Project 
We propose to create a distributed private database, where all users have equal rights. We propose to encrypt the file and divide it into parts. In addition, we suggest to create a blockchain where all manipulations with distributed file are stored, and manipulations itself - are multisignature transactions that provide that any manipulation with distributed file would be accepted only if all users of this private system sign it. Therefore, it guaranties that all proposed manipulations with data would be proceed only after all members of network accept it. And the history of uploaded file is unchangeable.
