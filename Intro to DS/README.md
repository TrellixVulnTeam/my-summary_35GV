# About
SkolTech course

The course gives an introduction to the main topics of modern data analysis such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, reinforcement and sequence learning, scalable algorithms. Each topic is accompanied by a survey of key machine learning algorithms solving the problem and is illustrated with a set of real-world examples. The primary objective of the course is giving a broad overview of major machine learning techniques. Particular attention is paid to the modern data analysis libraries which allow solving efficiently the problems mentioned above.

# Assignments

- 1: The goal of the assignment is to perform an intensive visual analysis of a real-life dataset and to find a good feature representation for the data. The original problem statement was to build an algorithm to classify time series into one of two classes.

- 2: Predict students grades (math and Portugal) using a set of demographic features. [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption)

# Project 
WESAD (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) Data Set

We tried to repeat results of this work :
Philip Schmidt, Attila Reiss, Robert Duerichen, Claus Marberger and Kristof Van Laerhoven. 2018. Introducing WESAD, a multimodal dataset for Wearable Stress and Affect Detection. In 2018 International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 18), October, 2018, Boulder, CO, USA. ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. [Web Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242969.3242985)

The problem:
- Stress detection
- Classification of person emotional condition
- Understanding of stress features
- Search optimal ML model
